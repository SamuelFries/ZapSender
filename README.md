ZapSender ðŸ“²

Description:
ZapSender is an automation tool for sending messages on WhatsApp. Using Python and Selenium, this project enables personalized mass messaging to multiple contacts via WhatsApp Web, making large-scale communication efficient and organized. Please ensure compliance with WhatsApp's policies and respect privacy guidelines when using this tool.

Features:

    Automated message sending to a predefined list of contacts.
    Message personalization with variables for unique messaging.
    Simple interface for configuring and managing contacts and messages.

Requirements:

    Python 3.8 or higher
    Selenium library for automation
    Google Chrome (or another Selenium-compatible browser)
    WebDriver for the chosen browser (e.g., chromedriver)

How It Works:

    The tool opens WhatsApp Web and prompts the user to scan the QR code for authentication.
    Once logged in, the bot navigates to each contact in the list and sends the designated message.
    The bot verifies each messageâ€™s successful delivery and generates a final report.

Legal Notice: This project is intended for personal and educational use. Sending unsolicited messages may violate WhatsApp policies and could result in account restrictions. Ensure that contacts receiving messages have consented to receive them.
